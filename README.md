This is a "simple" pathfinding program for raylib. I am new to this github stuff ,but I will try to respond to issues and stuff on here. I will also try to put some documentation in this read me sometime. Please note that I have modified my makefile to work on a linux system ,so I have no idea if it works on windows.
